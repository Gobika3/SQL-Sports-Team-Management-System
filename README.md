# Sports Team Management System  

## Project Overview

## Database Design  
The project consists of 5 tables with constraints:  
1. `Teams` – Stores team details  
2. `Players` – Stores player details  
3. `Matches` – Stores match details  
4. `Results` – Stores match outcomes  
5. `Coaches` – Stores coach details  

Relationships are defined using primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity.
